# Short-Term Memory Implementation Summary

## Goal

Implement short-term memory for the avatar to remember past interactions and adapt responses.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema

- Created [ScannedProduct](file:///Users/ajitreddy/Engineering/Projets/TalkAR/TalkAR%20-/mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/data/models/ScannedProduct.kt#L10-L16) entity to store scanned products with timestamps
- Updated [ImageDatabase](file:///Users/ajitreddy/Engineering/Projets/TalkAR/TalkAR%20-/mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/data/local/ImageDatabase.kt#L15-L35) to include version 2 with the new entity
- Created [ScannedProductDao](file:///Users/ajitreddy/Engineering/Projets/TalkAR/TalkAR%20-/mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/data/local/ScannedProductDao.kt#L9-L32) with queries to retrieve recent products (limited to last 3)

### 2. API Integration

- Modified [AdContentGenerationRequest](file:///Users/ajitreddy/Engineering/Projets/TalkAR/TalkAR%20-/mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/data/api/ApiClient.kt#L134-L137) model to include `previous_products` field
- Updated [AdContentGenerationService](file:///Users/ajitreddy/Engineering/Projets/TalkAR/TalkAR%20-/mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/data/services/AdContentGenerationService.kt#L12-L93) to fetch recent products and include them in API requests
- Added [saveScannedProduct](file:///Users/ajitreddy/Engineering/Projets/TalkAR/TalkAR%20-/mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/data/services/AdContentGenerationService.kt#L84-L92) method to store scanned products

### 3. UI Integration

- Updated [EnhancedARViewModel](file:///Users/ajitreddy/Engineering/Projets/TalkAR/TalkAR%20-/mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/ui/viewmodels/EnhancedARViewModel.kt#L17-L423) to handle image recognition and save scanned products
- Modified [Week2ARScreen](file:///Users/ajitreddy/Engineering/Projets/TalkAR/TalkAR%20-/mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/ui/screens/Week2ARScreen.kt#L23-L239) to call the new image recognition handler

## Key Features

1. **Local Storage**: Scanned products are stored locally in Room database with timestamps
2. **Automatic Context**: Last 3 scanned products are automatically included in API requests
3. **Seamless Integration**: No changes required to existing UI components
4. **Backward Compatibility**: API requests without previous products still work

## API Request Format

```json
{
  "product": "Pepsi",
  "previous_products": ["Coca-Cola", "Sprite"]
}
```

## Expected AI Response

```
"You loved Sprite last time â€” try Pepsi today!"
```
