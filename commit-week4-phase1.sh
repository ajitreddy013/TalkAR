# Commit 3: AvatarManager
echo "ðŸŽ¯ Committing: AvatarManager"
git add mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/ar/AvatarManager.kt
git commit -m "feat(week4): implement AvatarManager for dynamic 3D avatar loading

Core Features:
- Avatar registry system with image-to-avatar mapping
- Renderable loading from resources (res/raw) or remote URLs
- LRU renderable caching to avoid reloading
- Dynamic avatar loading based on detected image ID
- Lifecycle management for active avatar nodes
- Idle animation support (breathing, blinking, combined)

AvatarNode Features:
- Custom Node with animation support
- Breathing animation: 18 breaths/min, 2% scale variation
- Blinking animation: Random intervals (2-6 seconds)
- Embedded GLB animation support (foundation)
- Automatic cleanup on deactivation

Loading States:
- Idle, Loading, Loaded, Error tracking
- Reactive state flows for UI integration"

git add mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/ar/Avatar3DRenderer.kt
git commit -m "feat(week4): create Avatar3DRenderer for ARCore scene rendering

Features:
- ARCore session management with image database
- ArSceneView integration for 3D rendering
- Frame-by-frame tracking updates at 60 FPS
- Automatic avatar loading on image detection
- Tracking state management (TRACKING, PAUSED, STOPPED)
- Scene lifecycle (start, pause, resume, stop)

Image Tracking:
- Detects new AugmentedImages in frame
- Creates anchors at image center pose
- Loads appropriate avatar via AvatarManager
- Pauses animations when tracking is lost
- Removes avatars when tracking stops

Rendering States:
- NotStarted, Ready, Rendering, Stopped, Error
- Safe state transitions and error handling"

git commit -m "feat(week4): integrate AvatarManager with ImageAnchorManager

Updates:
- Constructor now requires AvatarManager instance
- handleDetectedImages enhanced to work with AugmentedImage
- Automatic 3D avatar loading when image is detected
- Anchor creation at image center pose
- Avatar node lifecycle tracking
- Error handling and logging

Flow:
1. Image detected via ARCore
2. Create anchor at image center
3. Load appropriate 3D avatar via AvatarManager
4. Attach avatar node to anchor
5. Track active avatar nodes"

# Commit 6: SimpleARViewModel Integration
echo "ðŸŽ® Committing: SimpleARViewModel Integration"
git add mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/ui/viewmodels/SimpleARViewModel.kt
git commit -m "feat(week4): add 3D avatar support to SimpleARViewModel

Features:
- AvatarManager initialization and lifecycle
- Default avatar registration (Generic Male, Female, Celebrity)
- Smart image-to-avatar mapping based on image name
- Avatar loading state tracking (AvatarLoadState)
- Integration with existing image recognition flow

Default Avatars:
- Generic Male Presenter (scale: 0.3f)
- Generic Female Presenter (scale: 0.3f)
- Celebrity Male Avatar - SRK Style (scale: 0.3f)
- All with BREATHING_AND_BLINKING animations

Mapping Logic:
- Images with 'srk' or 'celebrity' â†’ Celebrity male avatar
- Images with 'female' â†’ Female presenter
- Default â†’ Generic male presenter
- Manual mapping support via mapImageToAvatar()

States:
- Idle, LoadingAvatar, AvatarLoaded, AvatarError
- Reactive state flows for UI updates"
