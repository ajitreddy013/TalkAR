## Week 3: AI Pipeline Development (Oct 21-27, 2025)

### Phase 2 – AI Intelligence and Real-Time Interaction

#### Key Accomplishments:

1. **Complete AI Pipeline Implementation**

   - Text generation with OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and GroqCloud (LLaMA 3.2 Vision)
   - Audio synthesis with ElevenLabs and Google Cloud TTS
   - Lip-sync video generation with Sync.so API integration

2. **Sync.so API Integration**

   - Created `/api/v1/ai-pipeline/generate_lipsync` endpoint
   - Implemented exact API format: `{"audio_url": "...", "avatar": "..."}`
   - Added job tracking and polling mechanisms
   - Integrated database storage for generated video URLs

3. **Dual Provider Support**

   - Script generation: OpenAI (primary) / GroqCloud (fallback)
   - TTS generation: ElevenLabs (primary) / Google Cloud (fallback)
   - Configurable via environment variables

4. **Comprehensive Testing Suite**

   - Unit tests for all AI pipeline components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Mock services for development environments
   - Error handling validation

5. **Documentation and Setup Guides**

   - AI Pipeline README files for each component
   - Setup guide for AI services
   - Integration documentation

6. **Additional Features**
   - Job queue and status tracking system
   - Emotion support throughout the pipeline
   - Caching for frequently requested content
   - File persistence for generated scripts and audio
   - Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Week 4: Advanced Features and UI/UX (Oct 28 - Nov 3, 2025)

- 3D avatar integration with Sceneform/Filament
- Emotion and expression layer implementation
- Environmental realism features (light estimation, shadows, ambient audio)
- Performance optimization for various devices
- UI/UX enhancements for improved user experience

## Week 5: Testing and Refinement (Nov 4-10, 2025)

- Comprehensive testing across all components
- Bug fixes and performance optimizations
- Security enhancements and secret management
- Documentation updates and finalization
- Project completion and deployment preparation

## Current Status

The project is currently in Week 3, with the AI pipeline fully implemented and tested. All required integrations for Phase 2 have been completed, including the Sync.so API integration that converts speech + image/avatar → talking head video as requested.
