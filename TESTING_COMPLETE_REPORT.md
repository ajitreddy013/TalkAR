## 🚨 Security Audit Results

### High Severity Issues (7 found)
1. **Hardcoded Secrets**: Multiple instances of hardcoded passwords in test files
2. **Default Supabase Keys**: Using default Supabase keys in configuration

### Medium Severity Issues (4 found)
1. **Environment Configuration**: Default/example values in environment files
2. **Docker Security**: Missing non-root user specification
3. **CORS Configuration**: Localhost URLs in production context

### Recommendations
- Replace all hardcoded secrets with environment variables
- Generate new Supabase keys for production
- Update JWT secrets (minimum 32 characters)
- Specify non-root users in Dockerfiles
- Configure production URLs for deployment

## 📊 Performance Metrics (Expected)

### Response Time Targets
- Backend Health Check: < 2000ms
- Admin Dashboard Loading: < 4000ms
- API Endpoints: < 2000ms
- Concurrent Request Handling: Support 10+ concurrent requests

### Security Requirements
- Security headers present (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- SQL injection protection
- XSS vulnerability prevention
- Proper CORS configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
