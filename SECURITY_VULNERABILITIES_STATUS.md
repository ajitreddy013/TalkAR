## Remaining Vulnerabilities (2)

### Backend - Awaiting Upstream Fix ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### 1. validator.js - URL Validation Bypass (MODERATE)

- **Package:** validator
- **Version:** All versions ‚â§ 13.15.15 (latest available)
- **Severity:** Moderate (CVSS 6.1)
- **CVE:** GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx
- **CWE:** CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting)
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è No fix available yet
- **Impact:**
  - Used by Sequelize for URL validation
  - Potential XSS vulnerability in URL validation
  - Low risk in our implementation (server-side validation only)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

- Monitor validator.js releases for security updates
- Sequelize validation is used server-side only (no direct user input to URLs)
- Additional input sanitization in place via Joi validation
- Risk is minimal in current architecture

#### 2. sequelize - Dependency Vulnerability (MODERATE)

- **Package:** sequelize
- **Current Version:** 6.37.7 (latest stable)
- **Severity:** Moderate (inherited from validator)
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Waiting for validator.js fix
- **Impact:**
  - Indirectly affected by validator vulnerability
  - No direct vulnerability in Sequelize itself

**Mitigation Strategy:**

- Using latest stable version of Sequelize
- Will update immediately when validator.js releases a patched version
- Consider migration to Sequelize v7 when it reaches stable release
