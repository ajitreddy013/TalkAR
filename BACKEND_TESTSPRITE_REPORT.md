## ❌ Failed Tests Analysis

### Remaining Issues (31 failures - Down from 49)

#### 1. **Admin Authentication System (5 failures - IMPROVED from 8)** 🟡

**Status:** Partially Fixed - Basic auth working, token persistence issues remain

**Still Failing:**

- Admin dashboard access (token not persisting across tests)
- Bulk operations (activate/deactivate)
- Analytics retrieval
- Pagination
- Search functionality

**Root Cause:**

```
Token generation works but not persisting between tests
- authToken/adminToken variables not shared properly
- Need to restructure test suite for better token management
```

**Fix Priority:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Auth works, but test isolation needed

**Recommended Action:**

```typescript
// Create shared setup for authenticated requests
let testContext: { authToken?: string; adminToken?: string } = {};

beforeEach(async () => {
  // Register and login to get fresh tokens
  const userResponse = await register("user@test.com", "Pass123!");
  testContext.authToken = userResponse.body.token;

  const adminResponse = await register("admin@test.com", "Pass123!", "admin");
  testContext.adminToken = adminResponse.body.token;
});
```

---

#### 2. **Database Constraints (10 failures)** �

**Impact:** High - Blocks all admin operations

**Failing Tests:**

- Admin user registration (500 error)
- Admin token generation
- Admin dashboard access
- Bulk operations (activate/deactivate)
- Analytics retrieval
- Pagination
- Search functionality

**Root Cause:**

```
Error: User already exists
- Auth service not properly clearing test data
- Admin role validation failing
- JWT token generation for admin role broken
```

**Fix Priority:** 🔥 **CRITICAL** - Must be fixed immediately

**Recommended Action:**

```typescript
// Fix in src/services/authService.ts
- Clear users database between test runs
- Add proper admin role validation
- Fix JWT payload for admin users
```

---

#### 2. **Database Constraints (10 failures)** 🔴

**Impact:** High - Blocks image and dialogue operations

**Failing Tests:**

- Image creation in tests
- Dialogue addition
- Foreign key relationships
- Update operations
- Delete operations

**Root Cause:**

```
Database constraint violations
- Test database not properly reset
- Foreign key constraints not configured
- Schema mismatch between test and production
```

**Fix Priority:** 🔥 **CRITICAL**

**Recommended Action:**

```typescript
// Fix in tests/setup.ts
beforeEach(async () => {
  await sequelize.sync({ force: true });
  await createTestData();
});
```

---

#### 3. **Sync API Job Status (1 failure)** 🟡

**Impact:** Medium - Job tracking not working

**Issue:**

- Returns 500 instead of 404 for non-existent jobs
- Error handling needs improvement

**Fix Priority:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**

**Recommended Action:**

```typescript
// Fix in src/services/syncService.ts
if (!job) {
  throw new NotFoundError("Job not found"); // Return 404
}
```

---

#### 4. **Mock API Error Handling (10 failures)** 🟡

**Impact:** Low - Test mocks not properly configured

**Issue:**

- Mocked API errors not being caught
- Fallback mechanisms working but tests expect errors
- Response validation too lenient

**Fix Priority:** 🟢 **LOW**

## 🐛 Bug Reports

### Bug #1: Admin Authentication Broken

**Severity:** � Medium (Was Critical - NOW IMPROVED)  
**Priority:** P1 (Downgraded from P0)  
**Status:** ✅ **Partially Fixed**

**Description:**
Admin authentication now works correctly. Remaining issues are with token persistence across test cases.

**What Was Fixed:**

- ✅ Admin user registration
- ✅ User duplicate detection (returns 400)
- ✅ Invalid credentials handling (returns 401)
- ✅ User clearing between tests

**Remaining Issues:**

- Token not persisting for admin operations tests
- Need better test context management

**Affected Tests:** 5 tests in Admin API suite (down from 8)

### Bug #2: Test Database Not Reset Between Tests

**Severity:** � Medium (Was Critical - NOW IMPROVED)  
**Priority:** P1 (Downgraded from P0)  
**Status:** ✅ **Partially Fixed**

**Description:**
User database now properly clears between tests. Image/Dialogue database constraints still have issues.

**What Was Fixed:**

- ✅ Users cleared between tests via clearUsers()
- ✅ Auth tests now properly isolated

**Remaining Issues:**

- Image creation still fails in some tests

### Bug #3: Sync Job Status Returns Wrong HTTP Code

**Severity:** ✅ **FIXED**  
**Priority:** P2  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Description:**
Now correctly returns 404 for non-existent jobs instead of 500.

**Fix Applied:**

```typescript
// src/services/syncService.ts
const job = syncJobs.get(jobId);
if (!job) {
  const error: any = new Error("Job not found");
  error.status = 404; // ← Fixed!
  throw error;
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Test now passes
