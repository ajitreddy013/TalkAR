---

### 4. **Mobile Video Cache** ✅

**Commit:** `feat: implement mobile video cache with LRU eviction`

**What was implemented:**

- Created `VideoCacheManager.kt` for local video storage
- LRU (Least Recently Used) cache eviction policy
- Cache configuration:
  - Max cached videos: 3
  - Max cache size: 50MB
- Cache functionality:
  - `cacheVideo()` - Download and store video locally
  - `getCachedVideoPath()` - Retrieve cached video file path
  - `clearCache()` - Remove all cached videos
  - `getCacheStats()` - Get cache statistics
- Integration with `TalkARApplication` singleton
- Use `file://` URIs for cached videos in ExoPlayer

**Files modified:**

- `mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/data/cache/VideoCacheManager.kt` (NEW)
- `mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/TalkARApplication.kt`
- `mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/ui/viewmodels/SimpleARViewModel.kt`

---

### 5. **Video Preloading** ✅

**Commit:** `feat: add video preloading for next scripts`

**What was implemented:**

- `preloadNextScriptVideo()` - Preload next dialogue's lip-sync video in background
- `preloadPopularVideos()` - Preload videos for frequently detected images on app startup
- Automatic background caching after current video loads
- Uses `VideoCacheManager.preloadVideo()` for async caching
- Reduces latency for sequential script playback

**Files modified:**

- `mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/ui/viewmodels/SimpleARViewModel.kt`

---

### 6. **Performance Metrics** ✅

**Commit:** `feat: add performance metrics tracking for latency, FPS, and memory`

**What was implemented:**

- Created `PerformanceMetrics.kt` singleton for tracking
- Metrics tracked:
  - **Image detection latency** (avg)
  - **Video load latency** (avg, target: <3s)
  - **API call latency** (avg)
  - **FPS** (current, target: ≥30 FPS)
  - **Memory usage** (current, target: <500MB)
  - **Cache hit rate** (percentage)
- Integration points:
  - `recordImageDetectionLatency()` on image detection
  - `recordVideoLoadLatency()` when video is ready
  - `recordApiCallLatency()` after backend API calls
  - `recordCacheHit/Miss()` on video cache access
- Automatic warnings when targets are exceeded
- `printSummary()` for performance reports

**Files modified:**

- `mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/performance/PerformanceMetrics.kt` (NEW)
- `mobile-app/app/src/main/java/com/talkar/app/ui/viewmodels/SimpleARViewModel.kt`

## 📊 Performance Targets

| Metric                   | Target      | Implementation                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Video Playback Start** | < 3 seconds | ✅ Tracked in `PerformanceMetrics`   |
| **Frame Rate**           | ≥ 30 FPS    | ✅ Monitored via `recordFrame()`     |
| **Memory Usage**         | < 500 MB    | ✅ Tracked via `updateMemoryUsage()` |
| **Cache Hit Rate**       | Maximize    | ✅ LRU cache with 3-video limit      |

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Launch app and detect an image
- [ ] Verify haptic feedback on image detection
- [ ] Check that loading placeholder appears during video fetch
- [ ] Confirm video playback starts automatically
- [ ] Tap avatar to pause/play video
- [ ] Verify haptic feedback on tap
- [ ] Detect same image again to test cache
- [ ] Check performance metrics in logs
- [ ] Test with Samsung A35 (if available)

### Performance Validation:

```kotlin
// In your AR screen or test activity:
PerformanceMetrics.updateMemoryUsage(context)
PerformanceMetrics.printSummary()
```

Expected log output:

```
=== Performance Summary ===
Avg Image Detection: XX.XXms
Avg Video Load: XX.XXms (Target: <3000ms)
Avg API Call: XX.XXms
Current FPS: XX.X (Target: ≥30)
Memory Usage: XXX.XXMB (Target: <500MB)
Cache Hit Rate: XX.X%
Total Events: XX
==========================
