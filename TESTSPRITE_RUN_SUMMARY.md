# TestSprite Run Summary - 2025-10-22

This document captures the attempt to run project-wide tests using TestSprite and the fallback test execution performed for the TalkAR repository.

## TestSprite execution

- Attempted to run TestSprite tools to generate and execute suites.
- Result: The TestSprite MCP server failed to start ("Process exited with code 1"), preventing suite generation/execution.
- Impact: Unable to execute TestSprite suites or generate TestSprite reports in this session.

### Suggested remediation

- Verify the TestSprite MCP server can start locally:
  - Ensure Node.js is available and working in the environment.
  - From the repo root, try starting the MCP server manually:
    - Optional: `node testsprite-mcp/dist/index.js`
  - Check for runtime errors and missing environment variables (e.g., API keys).
- Once the server starts reliably, re-run TestSprite to generate suites and reports.

## Fallback: repository test runs

While TestSprite was unavailable, backend tests were executed to validate core functionality.

### Backend (Jest)

- Working directory: `backend/`
- Install: npm ci
- Run: npm test
- Outcome: FAIL
  - Test Suites: 4 failed, 4 total
  - Tests: 20 failed, 36 passed, 56 total
  - Time: ~25.7s

Key failure categories observed:

- Performance thresholds exceeded (response/auth timings):
  - Examples:
    - Sync request response time: expected < 2000ms, received ~2005ms
    - Voice request response time: expected < 500ms, received ~1154ms
    - Authentication time: expected < 3000ms, received ~3860ms
- SyncService behavior mismatches in unit tests:
  - Expected status "processing" but received "completed"
  - Expected rejection on API error but promise resolved
  - Missing call expectations to axios endpoints
  - Job status error: "Job not found"
- An integration test exceeded default Jest timeout (10s) and needs an explicit timeout or faster simulation.

Console highlights (informational):

- Multiple mocked calls logged for sync video generation and voices fallback paths.
- Warnings about missing Sync API voices endpoint and defaulting to predefined voices.

### Admin Dashboard (React Scripts)

- Working directory: `admin-dashboard/`
- Install: npm ci
- Run: npm test
- Outcome: No tests found (exit code 1). Consider running with `--passWithNoTests` or adding tests under `src/**/__tests__` or `*.test.(ts|tsx)`.

## Next steps

1. Unblock TestSprite

- Investigate why the TestSprite MCP server exits with code 1 in this environment.
- Validate manual start: `node testsprite-mcp/dist/index.js` and review any runtime stack traces.
- If it requires environment variables (e.g., API_KEY), configure them and retry.

2. Stabilize backend tests

- Performance tests: relax thresholds or increase timeouts to reflect CI constraints, or optimize code paths if targets are strict.
- SyncService unit tests: align expectations with current implementation (e.g., mocked status), ensure axios mocks match headers and endpoints, and simulate error branches correctly.
- Add explicit Jest timeouts for long-running simulations.

3. Frontend tests

- Add minimal smoke tests for `admin-dashboard` or mark test script to pass when no tests exist (`react-scripts test --passWithNoTests`).

4. Re-run and report

- After addressing the above, re-run all suites and generate a consolidated report (HTML/Markdown) and, when available, TestSprite reports.
