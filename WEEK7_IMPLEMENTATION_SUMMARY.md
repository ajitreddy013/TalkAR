# Week 7 Implementation Summary

## Dynamic Script Generation & Personalization

### Overview

This week's implementation focuses on making AI output dynamic by automatically generating ad lines based on poster metadata, similar to how Slynk works.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Metadata-Driven Script Generation

- **Product Metadata Storage**: Created JSON-based storage system for product details
- **Metadata Fields Supported**:
  - `image_id`: Unique identifier for the poster/image
  - `product_name`: Name of the product
  - `category`: Product category (e.g., "Beverage", "Fashion")
  - `brand`: Brand name
  - `price`: Product price
  - `currency`: Price currency (e.g., "USD")
  - `features`: Array of product features
  - `description`: Detailed product description
  - `tone`: Desired tone for the advertisement (e.g., "excited", "enthusiastic")
  - `language`: Language for the script
  - `target_audience`: Array of target audience segments
  - `keywords`: Array of relevant keywords

#### 2. Enhanced Prompt Engineering

- **Dynamic Prompt Generation**: Automatically creates enhanced prompts based on available metadata
- **Tone-Aware Generation**: Adapts script style based on the specified tone (excited, enthusiastic, professional, etc.)
- **Feature Highlighting**: Incorporates key product features into the advertisement script

#### 3. Caching Strategy

- **Metadata Caching**: In-memory caching of product metadata for improved performance
- **Script Caching**: Existing caching mechanism extended to support metadata-based scripts

#### 4. Backward Compatibility

- **Fallback Behavior**: System gracefully falls back to existing functionality when no metadata is found
- **API Compatibility**: No changes required to existing API endpoints

### Technical Implementation

#### File Structure

```
backend/
├── data/
│   └── product-metadata.json      # Product metadata storage
├── src/
│   └── services/
│       └── aiPipelineService.ts   # Enhanced with metadata support
├── tests/
│   └── metadataScriptGeneration.test.ts  # Test cases
├── test-metadata-script.js        # Manual testing script
├── test-metadata-loading.js       # Metadata loading verification
└── SCRIPT_GENERATION_README.md    # Updated documentation
```

#### Sample Metadata

```json
{
  "image_id": "poster_01",
  "product_name": "Sunrich Water Bottle",
  "category": "Beverage",
  "tone": "excited",
  "language": "English",
  "brand": "Sunrich",
  "price": 29.99,
  "currency": "USD",
  "features": [
    "Eco-friendly materials",
    "Keeps drinks cold for 24 hours",
    "Leak-proof design"
  ],
  "description": "Stay hydrated in style with our premium water bottle made from sustainable materials."
}
```

#### Enhanced Prompt Template

```
Generate a 2-line voiceover for an advertisement about {product_name}.
Category: {category}
Brand: {brand}
Tone: {tone}
Language: {language}

Product Description: {description}
Key Features:
1. {feature_1}
2. {feature_2}
...

Price: {currency} {price}

Create an engaging, concise advertisement script that highlights the product's value proposition and appeals to the target audience.
```

### API Usage

#### Existing Endpoint (Enhanced)

```
POST /api/v1/ai-pipeline/generate_script
{
  "imageId": "poster_01",
  "language": "en",
  "emotion": "excited"
}
```

When metadata exists for the provided `imageId`, the system automatically generates a script based on the product metadata. When no metadata is found, it falls back to the existing behavior.

### Testing

#### Automated Tests

- Metadata loading and caching
- Prompt generation based on metadata
- Mock script generation with tone awareness
- Integration with existing pipeline
- Fallback behavior verification
- Error handling for malformed metadata

#### Manual Testing

Use the provided test scripts:

- `test-metadata-script.js`: Tests metadata-driven script generation
- `test-metadata-loading.js`: Verifies metadata loading functionality

### Performance Considerations

#### Response Times

- **Metadata Loading**: < 50ms (cached)
- **Prompt Generation**: < 10ms
- **AI Generation**: Same as existing (1-2 seconds for OpenAI, 0.5-1 second for GroqCloud)
- **Mock Generation**: < 100ms

#### Caching

- In-memory caching with 5-minute TTL for both metadata and generated scripts
- Automatic cache invalidation based on time-to-live

### Future Enhancements

#### Short-term Improvements

1. **Database Integration**: Store metadata in database instead of JSON files
2. **Advanced Personalization**: Incorporate user preferences and behavior data
3. **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare different script variations for effectiveness
4. **Multi-language Support**: Enhanced support for internationalization

#### Long-term Features

1. **Real-time Personalization**: Dynamic script generation based on real-time context
2. **Content Analytics**: Track script performance and user engagement
3. **Automated Metadata Extraction**: Extract metadata from product images using computer vision
4. **Voice Style Customization**: More granular control over voice characteristics

### Known Limitations

1. Currently uses JSON file storage (should be moved to database in production)
2. Limited tone options (can be expanded with more sophisticated prompt engineering)
3. No user preference integration yet
4. Manual metadata entry required (no automated extraction)

### Deployment Notes

1. Ensure `/data/product-metadata.json` is properly populated
2. No database schema changes required
3. No environment variable changes required
4. Backward compatible with existing implementations
